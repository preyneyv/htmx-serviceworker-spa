# HTMX + Service Worker SPA

I wanted to mess around with HTMX and Service Workers, so this combines both of
them in the worst way possible.

This project has a heavy service worker that serves API requests and responds
using HTML fragments. The lightweight client uses HTMX to enable interactivity
with minimal browser-side JS.

I might just have too much time on my hands.

## Roadmap

- Offline support
- Actual sample application
- Data persistence (IndexedDB mayhaps? :eyes:)
